We prepare two scripts to help the users prepare the Reddit dataset for NeutronStar training

the load_data.py script is used to extract the traning data from the original reddit and output the following four files:

reddit.labeltable

reddit.featuretablenorm

reddit.edge.txt

reddit.mask

the extract_train.cpp is used to convert the edge data from txt to binary, which is used for NeutronStar's input. 

The format of binary edge file is the same as **Gemini**. The edge-pairs are consective stored in the fine and each pair of edge occupies 8-byte storage.
